A scrapper for the Coursefinder platform from UofT. Checking continuously if a course has free spots must not be a manual activity. This script checks if the course has spot and, if it has, mail the coordinator asking to have the course added. It is a useful tool for other exchange students at UofT. For now, it works only for Gmail accounts.
